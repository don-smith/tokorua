Reactive Pairs
=======================

Reactive Pairs is a game that is more often called
[concentration or memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)) and was primarily built to learn a specific set of web development technologies.

## The game

The game is played by selecting 2 tiles. If they match, they stay visible and
you get points. If they don't match, the tiles flip back over. You keep going
